# Handoff

## Current checkpoint

M08c: int functions, prototypes, parameters, direct calls and recursion.
Branch: development. Public repository: https://github.com/0x6432/kcc
Commit identity: 0x42 <noreply@localhost> (repository-local).
M08a and M08b were tested, committed and pushed separately. M08c has the
recursion/ABI acceptance tests and final documentation. Use git log -1 --oneline
for the exact latest hash; this file avoids a circular reference to itself.

## Resume safely

1. Clone/fetch the public repository; reading requires no credentials.
2. Compare git rev-parse HEAD with git ls-remote origin refs/heads/development.
3. Preserve uncommitted/divergent work; fast-forward only a clean safe checkout.
4. Read architecture.md, milestones.md, limitations.md and component-contracts.md.
5. Run make clean && make test. If needed, build pinned QBE with
   sh scripts/build_qbe.sh tools, then run
   make test-codegen QBE="$PWD/tools/qbe-1.2/qbe".
6. Restore Clang/compiler-rt if missing; run make fuzz-lex fuzz-compile.
7. Obtain push authorization when needed. Do not put credentials in the repo,
   remote URLs, documentation or logs. Commit/push each tested checkpoint.

## Architecture and interactions

One implementation file per stage, concrete AST structs, on-demand lexer with
one cached token, recursive descent/BNF comments and Pratt expressions remain.
The TU contains an ordered external declaration list; prototypes and definitions
are distinct structs. Each definition references its declaration header. Sema
registers canonical functions in source order before checking definition bodies;
there is no forward hoisting. Prototypes share compatible name-independent types.
Calls resolve visible function symbols, respecting local ordinary-name shadowing.
Bare function values and indirect calls are unsupported.

Each parameter has a semantic local backlink. Parameters receive the first slots
and share the outermost body scope; nested blocks may shadow them. Scoped lookup
is separate from the all-local storage list. Scope/loop contexts restore on
failure and reset between functions. Call/loop/parameter semantic backlinks are
not ownership edges; do not recursively traverse them as AST children.
Sema runs once and inserts explicit lvalue loads, including in call arguments.
Source outlives AST/symbol spellings; destroy the arena before the source.

QBE codegen emits exported int functions with w parameters/results, entry alloc4
slots and stores for parameters. Local initialization stays at source positions.
All argument IL, including nested control flow, finishes before emitting a call
line. Argument lowering is left-to-right, not a C sequencing guarantee. Labels,
temporaries and loop frames reset per definition. Logical phi predecessors use
the actual current block label. A terminated block is not proof a loop returns.

## Supported subset and limits

Int literals/locals/parameters/returns; arithmetic, simple assignment, signed
comparisons, !/&&/||; scoped blocks, if/else, while/do/for, break/continue;
function prototypes/definitions, direct calls and direct/mutual recursion.
C23 () and (void) specify zero parameters. Prototype names optional; definition
names required until later C23 work. Main must take no parameters. Library units
need no main. Declared undefined functions are the host linker's responsibility.
Main fallthrough returns zero. Non-main ABI zero filler is not a promised C
implicit return value. No automatic local zeroing or missing-return warning.

No preprocessing, other types, pointers/function values, variadics, local
prototypes, globals/storage classes, comma/update/compound-assignment operators.
No full C23 conformance claim. Resource limits: 16 MiB source, expression and
statement nesting/typed depth 128, 512 external declarations, 256 functions,
128 parameters/arguments, 256 parameter/local slots and 4096 body items/function.
Runtime recursion has no added stack guard. Tests execute bounded defined C;
fuzzing compiles arbitrary inputs but never executes them.

## Tests and environment

GCC 11.5.0, Clang 15/compiler-rt and QBE 1.2 were used locally. Dependencies may
vanish after resets; keep artifacts small under the 4 GB sandbox budget. QBE
release/checksum are pinned in scripts/build_qbe.sh. Locally it is available at
/data/tools/qbe-1.2/qbe; do not assume that external path survives a reset.
GCC sanitizer SONAME lookup may need external /data/tools/sanitizer-runtime
links plus LD_LIBRARY_PATH, -fno-pie and -no-pie. CI needs no local workaround.

Tests cover syntax/constraints/AST, runtime/reference execution, source-order
visibility, signature compatibility, parameter/body scopes and resource bounds.
Separate-object ABI cases run both directions with 0/1/2/6/7/8/12/128 arguments,
signed boundaries and cross-compiler mutual recursion. CI selects GCC/Clang as
host compilers and runs executable/ABI tests with sanitized compiler builds too.
Final local results and remote CI verification are appended below after checks.

## Next milestone

M09: specify phase ordering, splicing, preprocessing-token classification and
source provenance before implementation. Keep on-demand tokens and parser
contracts explicit. Start with a small tested slice; macro expansion/rescanning
is M10 and includes/conditionals/stringizing/pasting are M11. Do not implement
all preprocessing in one commit. Track component impacts and limitations, run
regressions/sanitizers/fuzzing, commit/push and update this handoff each slice.

Final M08c local verification passed: GCC/Clang reference/runtime and ABI
tests, semantic-AST and ASan/UBSan. Fuzzing: lexer 336767, pipeline 472930
inputs in 21 seconds each. README example exits 120. M08a/M08b remote CI
passed (runs 38714173006 and 38714953000). Check M08c CI after its push;
do not infer remote success from these local passes.
