## Current checkpoint

M09a: source newline normalization, line splicing and physical source mappings.
Branch: development. Public repository: https://github.com/0x6432/kcc
Commit identity: 0x42 <noreply@localhost> (repository-local).
M08 is complete for the stated int subset. M08c remote CI passed:
https://github.com/0x6432/kcc/actions/runs/38715578290
M09a is its own tested commit/push. Get the latest exact hash from git log -1;
this document avoids a circular reference to its own commit.

## Resume safely

1. Clone/fetch the public repository; reading requires no credentials.
2. Compare git rev-parse HEAD with git ls-remote origin refs/heads/development.
3. Preserve uncommitted/divergent work; fast-forward only a clean safe checkout.
4. Read architecture.md, milestones.md, limitations.md and component-contracts.md.
5. Run make clean && make test. If needed, build pinned QBE with
   sh scripts/build_qbe.sh tools, then run
   make test-codegen QBE="$PWD/tools/qbe-1.2/qbe".
6. Restore Clang/compiler-rt if missing; run make fuzz-lex fuzz-compile.
7. Obtain push authorization when needed. Do not put credentials in the repo,
   remote URLs, documentation or logs. Commit/push each tested checkpoint.

## Architecture and interactions

source_load/source_from_bytes still load raw bounded bytes. source_prepare
runs explicitly before lexer_init and before any token spelling is borrowed.
It normalizes CRLF/lone CR, then deletes immediate backslash-newline pairs
while traversing original physical units. Do not rescan newly adjacent output.
This precedes comment recognition, so continued line comments and split comment
markers are intentional. No whitespace after backslash splice extension.

Prepared source.data/length and token location.offset/length are logical bytes.
Name lookup, types and QBE symbols keep using contiguous logical spelling.
Changed sources own optional physical_data/physical_length plus sparse offset
checkpoints; unchanged sources keep identity offsets without an extra buffer.
Lone CR changes bytes but needs no offset checkpoint. source_physical_offset
binary-searches the map; logical EOF maps to original EOF. Diagnostics use
physical lines/columns with eight-column tabs; --tokens prints physical starts.
Never use physical offsets to index logical spelling data.

Preparation is idempotent and transactional on allocation failure. Call it only
on an initialized source, before any borrowed spellings; destroy frees optional
buffers/maps too. Both fuzz harnesses and every lexer caller were updated.
Future callers must prepare explicitly; lexer_init asserts this precondition.
No full-file token vector or new parser grammar/API was introduced.

One implementation file per stage, concrete AST structs, on-demand lexer with
one cached token, recursive descent/BNF comments and Pratt expressions remain.
The TU contains an ordered external declaration list; prototypes and definitions
are distinct structs. Each definition references its declaration header. Sema
registers canonical functions in source order before checking definition bodies;
there is no forward hoisting. Prototypes share compatible name-independent types.
Calls resolve visible function symbols, respecting local ordinary-name shadowing.
Bare function values and indirect calls are unsupported.

Each parameter has a semantic local backlink. Parameters receive the first slots
and share the outermost body scope; nested blocks may shadow them. Scoped lookup
is separate from the all-local storage list. Scope/loop contexts restore on
failure and reset between functions. Call/loop/parameter semantic backlinks are
not ownership edges; do not recursively traverse them as AST children.
Sema runs once and inserts explicit lvalue loads, including in call arguments.
Source outlives AST/symbol spellings; destroy the arena before the source.

QBE codegen emits exported int functions with w parameters/results, entry alloc4
slots and stores for parameters. Local initialization stays at source positions.
All argument IL, including nested control flow, finishes before emitting a call
line. Argument lowering is left-to-right, not a C sequencing guarantee. Labels,
temporaries and loop frames reset per definition. Logical phi predecessors use
the actual current block label. A terminated block is not proof a loop returns.

## Supported subset and limits

Int literals/locals/parameters/returns; arithmetic, simple assignment, signed
comparisons, !/&&/||; scoped blocks, if/else, while/do/for, break/continue;
function prototypes/definitions, direct calls and direct/mutual recursion.
C23 () and (void) specify zero parameters. Prototype names optional; definition
names required until later C23 work. Main must take no parameters. Library units
need no main. Declared undefined functions are the host linker's responsibility.
Main fallthrough returns zero. Non-main ABI zero filler is not a promised C
implicit return value. No automatic local zeroing or missing-return warning.

No directives/macros, other types, pointers/function values, variadics, local
prototypes, globals/storage classes, comma/update/compound-assignment operators.
Partial phases only: no separate pp tokens, directives, encoding/UCNs/BOM,
#line presumed locations or macro provenance yet. Missing terminal newlines
remain an acceptance extension, not strict phase-2 validation. No synthetic
newline is appended. Allocation failures are handled but fault injection is
not yet tested. No full C23 conformance claim. Resource limits: 16 MiB source, expression and
statement nesting/typed depth 128, 512 external declarations, 256 functions,
128 parameters/arguments, 256 parameter/local slots and 4096 body items/function.
Runtime recursion has no added stack guard. Tests execute bounded defined C;
fuzzing compiles arbitrary inputs but never executes them.

## Tests and environment

GCC 11.5.0, Clang 15/compiler-rt and QBE 1.2 were used locally. Dependencies may
vanish after resets; keep artifacts small under the 4 GB sandbox budget. QBE
release/checksum are pinned in scripts/build_qbe.sh. Locally it is available at
/data/tools/qbe-1.2/qbe; do not assume that external path survives a reset.
GCC sanitizer SONAME lookup may need external /data/tools/sanitizer-runtime
links plus LD_LIBRARY_PATH, -fno-pie and -no-pie. CI needs no local workaround.

Tests cover syntax/constraints/AST, runtime/reference execution, source-order
visibility, signature compatibility, parameter/body scopes and resource bounds.
Separate-object ABI cases run both directions with 0/1/2/6/7/8/12/128 arguments,
signed boundaries and cross-compiler mutual recursion. CI selects GCC/Clang as
host compilers and runs executable/ABI tests with sanitized compiler builds too.
M09a adds source/oracle/physical-position regressions to make test and tests
phase-ordering executable behavior under LF/CRLF/CR. A binary corpus seed keeps
intentional NUL/high or CR bytes; ordinary source corpus files use LF. Existing
CI runs all source tests, compiler sanitizers, QBE/reference/ABI and both fuzz
paths. Final local/fuzz results and remote verification follow below.

## Next milestone

M09b: design separate preprocessing-token and language-token APIs. Retain
newline, leading whitespace and beginning-of-line state; keywords and int value
validation must happen after preprocessing. Preserve pp-number maximal munch
and borrowed spellings/provenance. Keep one-token on-demand parser lookahead,
not a TU token vector. Specify comment/newline behavior and all caller impacts
before implementation. Run regressions/sanitizers/fuzzing, commit/push and
update this handoff. Then M09c inserts the preprocessor facade and initial
null/directive dispatch. Do not implement macro expansion until M10.

M09a local verification passed: GCC/Clang, source/oracle/AST, QBE/reference
execution, separate-object ABI and ASan/UBSan. Final sanitized fuzzing completed
244776 lexer and 500452 pipeline inputs in 21 seconds each. Earlier runs also
passed (257740 lexer / 510224 pipeline). Retained workspace build artifacts are
under 10 MiB; dependencies outside the repo under 70 MiB. Verify M09a remote CI
after its push; do not infer remote success from local tests.
